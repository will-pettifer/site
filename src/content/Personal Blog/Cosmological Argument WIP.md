#### Part 1
We start by defining 3 categories of existence:

- Necessary - a thing which must exist.
- Impossible - a thing which must not exist.
- Possible - a thing which can exist, but also has the possibility to not exist.

An example of an Impossible existence would be a 'square triangle'. A triangle has exactly 3 sides and a square exactly 4. These two properties are mutually exclusive, and therefore there is no possible world in which a 'square triangle' could ever exist.

An example of a Possible existence would be a human. A human is born, and did not exist before their birth. A human dies, and does not exist after their death. It is entirely conceivable that that human's parents could have made the decision not to have them, and so there is a possible world in which they never existed in the first place.

We have yet to establish the existence of anything Necessary.

It is important to note that these three categories are all mutually exclusive and exhaustive. There is no fourth category that is not a sub-set of these three categories.
#### Part 2
Next, we will establish the Principle of Sufficient Reason.


#### Part 3
Next, we will establish that anything Possible must be Contingent on another existence distinct from itself.

The fact that a Possible existence could have not existed means that there is a question as to why it does exist. This question needs an answer; there needs to be a reason why it exists. If the explanation of its own existence is itself, then it must pre-exist itself. This is much like a mother giving birth to herself, an absurd regression. We are searching for an explanation as to why the thing exists, but all this offers us is an infinite loop with no real explanation for how the thing can exist in the first place. Therefore, there must be an external explanation for the existence of any Possible existence. We can call a Possible existence a Contingent existence because it must be Contingent on something other than itself.
#### Part 4
Next, we will prove by contradiction that there must be a Necessary existence.

We will imagine that the real world contains no Necessary existences. We know that there are Contingent existences such as you and me. The existence of these Contingencies requires explanation. If we take a real world example of a human, the reason they exist would be due to their ancestors, and they would exist due to some process by which they were created, and that leads back to the formation of the solar-system, and that is explained by the events following the Big Bang and so on. Essentially we are looking at a chain of prior explanations, and if we follow that chain we are going to come across one of 3 possibilities:

1. Everything depends on nothing. At the beginning of the chain there is a Contingent existence that was not explained by anything. For example, one might say that before the Big Bang there was nothing, it just happened for no reason. This is a clear violation of the definition of a Contingent existence and the Principle of Sufficient Reason.
2. The chain is infinite. There was no beginning, the chain of prior explanations goes back infinitely, with more and more Contingent existences providing more and more explanations. The problem with this becomes clear when we try to count backwards from infinity. We have no starting point. Even if we say 'infinity - 1, infinity - 2 ...' as we head towards 'infinity - infinity' we still never get to 0 because 'infinity - infinity' is undefined. As such, there is no explanation in an infinite regression of prior explanations. Each time we add an existence at the beginning of the chain to provide a reason for the rest of the chain to exist, we also then add the need for an explanation for that existence.
3. Inter-dependence. This could be arranged any number of ways, but the problem is always the same. We could imagine two initial Contingent existences which explain each other, like two deities who created each other. We could imagine a cycle, like the universe crunching and then causing a Big Bang that brings into existence that same universe. We could imagine a web, where Contingent existences are all explaining each other's existence. It doesn't matter how you arrange it, these are all round-about ways of saying that a thing depends upon itself. If there are two inter-dependent Contingencies, then A cannot exist without B first existing, B cannot exist without A first existing, and therefore A cannot exist without A first existing, but we have already established that this is absurd in Part 3. If there is a cycle, then it would look something like A cannot exist without B, B cannot exist without C, and C cannot exist without A, which once again means that A cannot exist without A first existing. The logic is the same for a web and any other arrangement we could imagine.

I cannot think of any structure other than the 3 listed above. If you can, let me know. Given that these are all absurd, and that there are only 3 categories of existence as defined in Part 1, and that Impossible existences can't exist, we can conclude that there must be a Necessary existence.
#### Part 5
Next, we will establish certain facts about this Necessary existence:
1. It is sufficiently powerful to create everything else that exists.
2. It is eternal, as if it began to exist or could cease to exist, then before and after its existence it would not exist, but it isn't possible for it to not exist as that violates the definition of Necessity.
#### Part 6
Next, we will prove that the Necessary existence has a will.

Everything else that exists, which I will from now on refer to as the Creation, is arranged in a specific manner. The speed of light is 299,792,458m/s, there are 8 planets that orbit the sun, etc. We can of course imagine the Creation being arranged in a different manner, or not existing at all.

(One might argue that there could be a multi-verse, in which every possibility is realised, and therefore there isn't really a specific arrangement. The problem with this is that your specific experience is of only this world, rather than a different one, so at some level there must be a degree of arrangement.)

This then leaves us the question of why it is arranged as it is. Why are there 8 planets, and not 7? Why couldn't the Universe be slightly larger, or slightly hotter? The explanation has to come back to the Necessary existence.

What function could there be that can distinguish between possibilities and then select one? It couldn't be basing its creation on something before it because there can't be anything before the Necessary existence. It must have made this arrangement of its own accord. What possible function could there be that can do this? The answer, rather beautifully, is within yourself. You know what it means to make decisions, even arbitrary ones, because you have a will of your own. This is the clearest and most intuitive way of understanding how the Necessary existence creates, it has a free will.

From this point on we should feel confident in describing this being as a person, as it clearly has a mind of its own. It is not some force of nature, or abstract spiritual concept, this is a real person that created you of its own free will. We will go even further, and call this being 'God'.
#### Part 7
Next, we will prove that the attributes of God are not limited.

Let's say God has the attribute of Knowledge, but he doesn't know everything. Why? Why does he know some things and not others, what is the explanation of this limitation?
