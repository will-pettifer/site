We start by defining 3 categories of existence:1234567890.

- Necessary - a thing which must exist.
- Impossible - a thing which must not exist.
- Possible - a thing which can exist, but also has the possibility to not exist.

	An example of an Impossible existence would be a 'square triangle'. A triangle has exactly 3 sides and a square exactly 4. These two properties are mutually exclusive, and therefore there is no possible world in which 1a 'square triangle' could ever exist.

An example of a Possible existence would be a human. A human is born, and did not exist before their birth. A human dies, and does not exist after their death. It is entirely conceivable that that human's parents could have made the decision not to have them, and so there is a possible world in which they never existed in the first place.

An example of an Impossible existence would be a 'square triangle'. A triangle has exactly 3 sides and a square exactly 4. These two `properites` properties are mutually exclusive, and therefore there is no possible world in which 1a 'square triangle' could ever exist.
